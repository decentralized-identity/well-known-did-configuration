# Well-Known DID Configuration

This specification defines a way for a website to prove that its DID is verifiably linked to that website. Well-Known DID configuration builds on and is an extension to the core [DID specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/). The examples in this spec of the [did:web Method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). Furthermore, it  establishes the `/.well-known/did-configuration.json` URI pattern, which is [IANA registered](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml).

> Note: The examples in this spec mostly make use of the [did:web Method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). However, this specification works with any DID method supporting the `services` property in the [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#services) (e.g. did:jwk and [did:key](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-key-spec/) don't support this, [did:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) and [did:iota](https://docs.iota.org/developer/iota-identity/references/iota-did-method-spec) do support it.)

## What this solves

The problem that was unsolved in the [DID core specification]() as well as in the [did:web Method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/) is proving that a DID belongs to a website and vice versa. To be more specific this specification links an [origin](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6454) with a DID. This means a DID cannot be linked to any website URL with path segments for example, only to the website [origin](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6454).

This specification makes this possible by building on the `LinkedDomains` service of the [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#services). The `serviceEndpoint` field contains the website [origin](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6454), which in turn hosts the `/.well-known/did-configuration.json`. The `did-configuration.json` file then holds a [Verifiable Credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) (VC) claiming the [origin](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6454). This [Verifiable Credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) must be signed with key material from the original [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#services) which contains the `LinkedDomains` service. 

> Note: The DID document can be hosted at the [IANA registered](https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml) well-known endpoint of the same origin, `/.well-known/did.json`, but this is specific to the [did:web Method specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/). The DID configuration however, works with any did method supporting the DID document services and these DID documents can be hosted anywhere, not necessarily at `/.well-known/did.json`.
